title: Non-negative matrix factorization and regularized regression for drug development
summary: Developed a non-negative matrix factorization and regularized regression based model for deconvoluting signals driven by biological perturbations in multiplexed experiments with high- dimensional measurements. Applied this approach to nominate biological factors that drive pancreatic cancer.
