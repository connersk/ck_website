Welcome! I recently graduated from MIT with a PhD in Computational and Systems Biology and am exploring job opportunities in data science, machine learning, software engineering, and/or computational biology. During my PhD, I developed and applied machine learning tools to analyze complex biological datasets. Prior to my PhD, I was a Downing Scholar at the Unversity of Cambridge, where I obtained an MPhil in Computational Biology. Before that, I obtained my BA in Chemistry from Pomona College. Outside of work, I love to rock climb, trail run, cook food and read science fiction.
