Welcome! I recently graduated from MIT with a PhD in Computational and Systems Biology and am exploring job opportunities in data science, machine learning, software engineering, and/or computational biology.

During my PhD, I developed and applied tools for analyzing complex biological datasets. In my first main project, I led an effort to generate and analyze a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of the small intestine with and without Environmental Enteropathy (EE) - an intestinal disorder that is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and is thought to contibute to childhood growth stunting and reduced oral vaccine efficacy. In my second main project, I co-led the development of a novel technology for screening drugs that leverages machine learning to enable drug screens that would otherwise be infeasible to conduct.

Prior to my PhD, I was a Downing Scholar at the Unversity of Cambridge, where I obtained an MPhil in Computational Biology. Before that, I obtained my BA in Chemistry from Pomona College.

Outside of work, I love to rock climb, trail run, cook food and read science fiction.
